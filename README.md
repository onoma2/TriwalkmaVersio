Conjuring up to three walkamas with a Wand



An attempt to imagine what would happen if Nick Reinhard of Tera Melos would smash Instruo Lubdah and Make Noise Morphagene into mtl.asm Count to 5 enclosure to show off his microsound skills to the Knobs of the same YouTube channel. 
Many things will get destroyed in the process, but some more will stay and prosper.

If some tape emulating skwemorphs attempt to recreate a vintage studio feel with saturation, real-time editing and an image of a big and expensive reel, Triwalkma was imagines as an homage to portable cassette players that are used at
The moment as stand alone voices and texture generators, providing tactile feel to the short recordings that are looped on a cut out tape. 

Broken trio of stereo “walkmas” that continuously record signal and you can only control the destination of recordings but not the mix of the them by the WAND.

###Controls###


**Blend** – dry/wet mix 
**Regen** - respective feedback mix of all the walkmas
**Dub** – overdub %, should create too much volume increase over its course, but I wouldn't recommend keeping it open for the long time without supervision.

__walkmas__ 

**left, mid, right** – well this is the "varispeed" you craved. From 1/4 to *2. Back or forth.
(Speed of ~1 (aka _original sound pitch_) across all the Walkmas is achieved by the following steps:
1) move left, mid and right to maximum. Then slowly decrease/rotate the the left knob CCW while looking on the right pair of LEDs. At when the speed crosses 1 the left led of the right pair will turn bright green. You are looking for that moment on the virtual cassette tape. Original pitch is near the border. The closer you get the more original it is. There is no dent on the controller, you should not pretend that you have enough precision to catch it.
Right walkma can be "tuned" the same way. Mid one also follows the same scale but both the leds will start blinking milder when all the three knobs are around 1. The panel picture shows approximate positions.
